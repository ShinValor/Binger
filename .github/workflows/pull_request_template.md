The text below is less of a template and more of a reminder of what to include in a pull request description to make it clear to reviewers.
## Overview
Clear pull request descriptions give reviewers everything they need to QA changes and examine code. They:
- Explain why these changes are needed
- Explain how these changes effect users
- Explain how these change effect developers
- Explain–in detail–what PR reviewers need to do to thoroughly test and QA these changes
**Provide user stories to explain effects on users**
The “As a user...” style of describing behavior is a helpful way to shift your and reviewers' perspectives to that of the end user.
- As a user what was the problem and what steps produced the problem?
- As a user what steps do I need to take now to test this fix?
- As a user what should I expect to see?
**Link to Related Issue**
Use keywords like related, relates, resolves, fixes followed by a link to the issue(s). ex fixes #456
**Dependencies**
List any new dependencies that may have been introduced and inform testers they will need to install them locally.
**How To Test**
Provide clear instructions for testing the changes.
**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help show the outcomes of this solution.
