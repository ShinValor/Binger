Hello, I am computer science and biochem major. My interest in cs kind of wonders around, but for now i mostly enjoy learning new things about different areas in computer science.
So far i have experienced AI, ML and CV and next semester I will be trying out computational Linguistics. I am also a very active person and the current sports I enjoy playing are tennis and running.
